# GrievEase
GrievEase is a web-based platform designed to make it effortless for students to report  grievances and have them addressed by college authorities
After a brief registration, students can submit complaints by choosing a clear category—Academic, Infrastructure, Lost & Found, or Student Welfare—and describing the issue in plain language. Each complaint is assigned a unique reference number and routed to the appropriate faculty member or committee, removing uncertainty about where concerns should go and cutting out lengthy manual handoffs.  The platform centers on clarity and accountability: students can follow the progress of their complaints, view responses from administrators, and receive timely updates as actions are taken. Administrators can prioritize, assign, and annotate cases, making it easy to track who is responsible and what steps have been taken. For sensitive situations, an anonymous reporting option lets 
students raise issues without fear, while audit entries and notes create a transparent record for later review. By turning an often informal and inconsistent process into a structured workflow, GrievEase encourages prompt reporting and faster resolution.  Ultimately, GrievEase streamlines complaint handling, strengthens trust between students and staff, and supports a safer, more responsive campus community.
